# Sardis Stablecoins

Based on newest, yet battleground tested blockchain technology intensely built for speed, the dedicated Sardis stable-coin blockchains will be created for each major FIAT currency-pegged stablecoin. This means that the USD Sardis stablecoin will have its own blockchain, as well the EUR, GBP, RUB, AED, TRY, and so on. This will provide unlimited horizontal scaling, supporting potentially millions of transactions each second. Each wallet account on these stablecoin blockchains will have itâ€™s own private ledger-blockchain. Thus a transaction between two parties will minus the sending account, while writing the corresponding plus to the receiving account almost instantaneously.
