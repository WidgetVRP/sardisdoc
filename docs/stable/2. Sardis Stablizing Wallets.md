# Sardis Stabilizing Wallets

Each Sardis stablecoin blockchain will be governed by a stabilizing wallet. These wallets will have a reserve of 50 trillion stablecoins, put into, or pulled out of circulation as needed, keeping the price of the respective coin one-to-one with the fiat currency it is pegged to. The behavior of these wallets will be hard coded to the smart contracts situated on the main blockchain thus no after-intervention will be possible to their functioning.
