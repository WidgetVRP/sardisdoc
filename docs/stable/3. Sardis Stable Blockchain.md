# Sardis Dedicated Stablecoin Blockchains

Sardis will also scale the operations of its stable coins horizontally. Each stable coin pegged to major FIAT currencies or derivatives will be ledgered on its own dedicated blockchain. These will not support smart contracts, having a lean, energy efficient structure. The transaction times for these will be measured in seconds, just as with the contract and payment mainnets. The horizontal scaling paradigm will extend to user accounts as well, with each user account supporting their own micro blockchain that finalize payments in real time. Instead of writing each transaction on the main chain ledgers, the stable coin ledger will only account for the current balance information of the user accounts as reported by their micro chains.
